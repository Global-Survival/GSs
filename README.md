# Global Survival synonymous
### (as originally derived from [automenta/gss](http://github.com/automenta/gss)) is a composite model,
### made of various, independently developed applications which 
### support and rely on a common [indicator plugin-system](http://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/global-survival/Ojw4KXNzTZ4) (GSs) 
### for the purpose of...

 * Calculating whether a complete manifest of needs can be satisfied by the 'available' resources -- illustrating how a community is likely to thrive or suffer.

 * Suggesting alternate means of satisfying a more essential need, when shortages occur; for example, by substituting an alternate source of a nutrient.

 * Attempting to provide a means of evacuation, if needs are not likely to be met

 * Analyzing physical locations in terms of geology, biology, and human social measures

 -Providing methods for transitioning from one location to another

...in terms of the appropriateness of that method for a biological organism -- according to certain measurement heuristics.

### Each of these tools is simple to understand and free for all to use, modify, and improve.


### Appropriateness...

  * of a given environment,

  * at a specific time,

  * for a specific organism (human[man,woman,boy,girl], animal, or plant),

### ...may be calculated in terms of its needs.

### The development of this protocol and tool suite is equivalent to 
### a planetary constitution that can logically grant all beings 
### equal rights to existence.
